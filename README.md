#**Vagrant**                                               ---                                                        ##Purpose                                                  This is my first mark down file.                           In this project we are required to use vagrant in order to create an ubuntu virtual environment,this is specifically for people who are using windows or macs OS.

The goal of this project is to teach us how to create a git repository locally, in your machine without the sandbox.
